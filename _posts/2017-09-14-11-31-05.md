title: Allow 3rd-party Extensions in Chrome on macOS
slug: chrome-extension
---
Google Chrome restricts installing 3rd-party extensions for better security. The official method to bypass such limitation is to add custom [policy](https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3). In current version (60) of Chrome, there is a policy entry for whitelisting extension called [`ExtensionInstallWhitelist`](https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3#ExtensionInstallWhitelist). On macOS, one can easily add such policy by running the following command in Terminal:

```bash
defaults write com.google.Chrome ExtensionInstallWhitelist -array id
```

Replace `id` with your actual extension ID correspondingly.  The ID can be found in [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) by clicking the "Developer mode" box. If you want to add multiple IDs, put `id1 id2 id3`, etc. after `-array`. Restart Chrome to take effect. To check if the policy works, visit [chrome://policy](chrome://policy). To remove the policy, simply run:

```bash
defaults delete com.google.Chrome ExtensionInstallWhitelist
```

This could help install open-source Chrome extensions such as [BaiduExporter](https://github.com/acgotaku/BaiduExporter) without warning.
