## About

This is my personal blog for recording my own thoughts, feelings, etc. Every article has a place for comments. Feel free to leave messages if you have something to say. I seldom use any social networking tools, except [Github](https://github.com/linusyang). Ping me on Github if necessary. I would be happy if this blog ever helps you. Hope you'll enjoy reading this blog!
